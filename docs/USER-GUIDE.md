# QR Check-In System — User Guide

## What Is This?

QR Check-In is a simple, fast way to manage event registration using QR codes. Attendees receive a unique QR code when they register, and staff scan these codes at the door to check them in. No paper lists, no manual name lookups, just point and scan.

## For Attendees

### Getting Your QR Code

When you register for an event, you'll receive your QR code in one of these ways:

**By Email:**
- Check your inbox for an email with your QR code attached
- The email includes a PNG image you can save or screenshot
- Show this QR code at check-in

**On the Registration Confirmation Page (if enabled by your organizer):**
- After submitting registration, you may see your QR code displayed immediately
- Tap the QR code for a full-screen version that's easier to scan
- Take a screenshot or save the image

### Tips for Easy Check-In

**Before you arrive:**
1. **Maximize your screen brightness** — Bright screens scan much faster
2. **Save the QR code** — Screenshot the email or save the image to your photos
3. **Don't crop the image** — The white space around the QR is important

**At check-in:**
1. Open your QR code (email, photo, or full-screen mode)
2. Hold your phone 4-6 inches from the staff member's scanner
3. Keep both phones steady for 1-2 seconds
4. If you see glare, tilt your phone slightly

**If scanning doesn't work:**
- Check your screen brightness is all the way up
- Clean your screen (smudges cause problems)
- Try the full-screen mode (tap the QR code)
- Ask staff to try manual lookup with your name or email

## For Event Staff

### Scanning QR Codes

**Using the Scanner:**
1. Open the scanner page (`/` or `/scanner`) on your phone
2. Tap "Start Scanner" to activate the camera
3. Ask the attendee to show their QR code
4. Hold your phone 4-6 inches from their screen
5. You'll hear a sound and see confirmation when it works

**Phone-to-Phone Tips:**
- Ask attendees to turn brightness to maximum
- Hold phones 4-6 inches apart (too close = blurry, too far = small)
- Avoid glare by tilting either phone if you see reflections
- The scanner works best in normal room light (not direct sunlight)

**Color Codes:**
- 🟢 **Green** — Check-in successful
- 🟡 **Yellow** — Already checked in (showing their details)
- 🔴 **Red** — Invalid code or error (try manual lookup)

### Manual Check-In (When QR Won't Scan)

If a QR code won't scan:
1. Use the "Or check in by name" search field on the scanner page
2. Type the attendee's name or email
3. Tap their name in the results
4. Tap "Check in"

### Handling Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Invalid QR Code" | Ask attendee to refresh their email or re-send from admin panel |
| "Already Checked In" | Show them their check-in time, they may have forgotten |
| QR won't scan | Use manual lookup with their name/email |
| Scanner won't start | Check camera permissions in your browser settings |
| Offline mode active | Check-ins will sync when you reconnect to WiFi |

## For Event Administrators

### Setting Up an Event

**1. Create the Event:**
- Go to the Admin Dashboard
- Click "New Event"
- Enter event name (this appears in emails)
- Save

**2. Import Attendees:**
- Click "Import CSV" on your event
- Prepare a CSV file with identity data
- Required mapping contract:
  - **Email** must be mapped
  - map **both** first and last name, **or** map a **full-name fallback** column
- Upload the file and map headers in the import screen
- Optional: add any extra columns and choose your own field labels (saved in attendee `source_data`)
- Choose import behavior:
  - **Add new only**: skips rows where email already exists
  - **Merge/update existing**: updates existing attendee details by event+email
  - **Replace event roster**: deletes current event attendees, then imports CSV rows
- Review import summary and warnings (duplicates, malformed rows, encoding hints)
- Download skipped rows CSV if any rows were rejected

**CSV Format:**
```csv
email,first_name,last_name,company
alice@example.com,Alice,Smith,TechCorp
bob@example.com,Bob,Johnson,Design Inc
```

**3. Send QR Codes:**
- After importing, you'll see an option to "Send QR Codes via Email"
- This sends a QR code email to every imported attendee
- ⚠️ **Warning:** This sends actual emails to real people. Double-check your list first.
- Review the results to see sent/failed counts

### Managing Attendees

**Viewing Attendees:**
- Select your event from the dropdown on the admin dashboard
- See check-in status, company, dietary restrictions
- Search by name or email

**Checking Someone In Manually:**
- Find the attendee in the list
- Click the QR icon to show their code
- Staff can scan this, or you can mark them checked in

**Re-sending a QR Code:**
- Find the attendee, click the QR icon
- Click "Send QR Code to Email"
- Useful if someone lost their email

**Deleting an Attendee:**
- Find the attendee in the list
- Click the trash icon
- Confirm deletion (this cannot be undone)

### Exporting Data

**Export Attendees:**
- Select attendees (checkboxes) or select all
- Click "Export Selected"
- Downloads a CSV with all registration data
- Useful for post-event analysis or badge printing

### Understanding Check-In Statistics

**Check-in Rate:**
- Shows percentage of registered attendees who've checked in
- Updates in real-time as staff scan codes

**Offline Mode:**
- If staff lose internet, check-ins queue locally
- Data syncs automatically when connection returns
- You'll see an "offline mode" indicator when this happens

## Troubleshooting

### Attendees Can't Find Their QR Code

**Check:**
1. Did they check their spam/promotions folder?
2. Did they register with a different email?
3. Is the email still sending? (Large lists take time)

**Fix:**
- Use admin panel to re-send individual QR codes
- Or look them up manually at check-in

### QR Codes Won't Scan

**Attendee phone issues:**
- Screen brightness too low
- Screen protector causing glare
- QR code image is cropped (missing white border)
- Phone screen is cracked or very dirty

**Staff scanner issues:**
- Camera lens dirty
- Too much glare from lights
- Holding phones too close or too far

### Email Not Sending

**Check configuration:**
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in environment
- Check `FROM_EMAIL` is verified in Resend dashboard
- Resend free tier only sends to your own email until domain is verified

**Bulk email failed partially:**
- Review the results summary
- Some emails may fail due to invalid addresses
- Re-send to failed addresses individually

### Duplicate Registrations

CSV import dedupes by **event + email**:
- Same email in one file twice → later rows are skipped
- Add mode + import same file twice → existing rows are skipped
- Merge mode + import same file twice → existing rows are updated
- Replace mode always rebuilds the event roster from the uploaded CSV
- Check import summary for imported/updated/deleted/skipped counts and warnings

## Security & Privacy

**What we store:**
- Name, email, phone, company (if provided)
- Check-in time and device
- QR token (random, single-use per event)

**What we don't do:**
- Share attendee data with third parties
- Store QR codes as images (we generate them on-demand)
- Allow unlimited QR scans (each check-in is logged)

**Staff access:**
- Staff can only see attendees for their assigned event
- Scanner doesn't show full lists (privacy protection)
- Admin access should be limited to organizers
